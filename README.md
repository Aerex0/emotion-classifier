# Emotion Classifier

A deep learning model for classifying emotions from text using PyTorch/TensorFlow.

## Overview

Built a neural network to classify text into different emotion categories. The model successfully trains and shows convergence, as demonstrated in the loss plots.

## Features

- Custom neural network architecture for emotion classification
- Training pipeline with loss visualization
- Dataset handling and batching
- Model shows stable convergence

## Upcoming Enhancements

- Advanced text preprocessing pipeline (tokenization, cleaning, normalization)
- Comprehensive evaluation suite (accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrices)
- Train/validation/test split implementation
- Hyperparameter tuning and optimization
- Model persistence and deployment configuration
